I always wondered how true the old adage of saving women and children first (along with having a higher social status) really was so I used the following 3 variables Age, Sex, and Pclass (1st, 2nd and 3rd class) from the Titanic disaster to help identify the rate of survival patterns by graphing them. What I found was that in order of Pclass (1st, 2nd and 3rd), the percentage of females that survived was 97%, 89% and 49%. Pclass didn't though seem to have much of an effect for the men onboard the Titanic that day and in order of class (*1st, 2nd and 3rd), the percentage of males that survived was 34%, 15% and 15%. All the children in 1st and 2nd class, except for one female child in 1st class survived, but the children in 3rd class had a significantly higher mortality rate. It's interesting to note that the data set does not contain any information on how the victims actually died but the consensus among doctors is that 80-85% would have succumed to hyperthermia within 10-15 minutes of hitting the frigid waters.
