# WILL CHANGE STRINGS INTO FACTORS AFTER COMBINING BOTH CSV FILES because the factors have to line up perfectly when combining

#str() on an R object, it prints a summary of the object's structure, including its type, length, and contents. It can be used with any R object, including data frames, matrices, vectors, lists
# median(sst.train$Age, na.rm=TRUE) 28  na.rm=TRUE gives the median in the absence of missing values & the $ symbol extracts a single variable or column (age)from a data frame.
# when splitting the files back build a TRUE or FALSE column to differentiate between the the 2 csv files ( train = T or test = F)
sst.train$IsTrainSet <- TRUE
sst.test$IsTrainSet <- FALSE
```

```{r}
# find the number of columns "ncol" of each to prepare for combining
ncol(sst.train) #13
ncol(sst.test) #11 at first but 12 (as expected because sst.test should ONLY have the survived column missing) columns after running sst.test$IsTrainSet <- FALSE (you created that column) & refreshing data DONT FORGET MOVING FORWARD
# next make sure column names are spelled exactly the same by clicking on the csv files in the Environment panel or in the console using names(sst.train)
```

```{r}
#add a survived col in test filled w na to make both 13 columns for combining purposes

```

```{r}
#build a filter querying sst.full just where the embarked column is = null and only gives back Embarked (should be just 2 and we can replace the empty spots with the mode which should be category S. rerun table(sst.full$Embarked) to double check, then run it again to make sure S is now 916 and there is no empty category

```

```{r}

#we can build on it to replace the na's with the median age (but to find the median age we have to use na.rm like so- median(sst.full$Age, na.rm= TRUE) because we haven't replaced the missing values yet) we can then assign it to a variable before we query column "Age"] within Data set sst.full[
median(sst.full$Age, na.rm = TRUE) #now assign it to a variable

age.median <- median(sst.full$Age, na.rm = TRUE)

#I could've just gone with sst.full[is.na(sst.full$Age)),"Age"] <- 28 but I need to get into the habit of using the variable for scripts that does an automated processes so it automatically updated (this sentence is redundant on itself but I'm tired. fix later)
```

```{r}
is.na(sst.full$Age)#run again to make sure there are no NA's (true) and check console or 
table(is.na(sst.full$Age)) #which returns FALSE 1309
```

```{r}
#fare is missing several values as well using drop down arrows
sst.full$Fare # capitalization counts here (Fare)gives us is.na(sst.full$Fare) which Ill wrap w table

table(is.na(sst.full$Fare))
# cleaned Fare of missing values
fare.median <- median(sst.full$Fare, na.rm = TRUE)

```

```{r}
#You can arrow up to rerun scripts!! reuse table(is.na(sst.full$Fare)) to see if the one true is now missing and we now have FALSE 1309
# no more missing values so we can build our predictive model after re-seperating TEST AND TRAIN by querying the column added earlier sst.full$IsTrainSet ==TRUE and throwing it back into sst.train and then check the tail for 891 objects

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
